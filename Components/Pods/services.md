# NodePort

maps a port on the node to a port on the pod.
- node ports can only be in a valid range : 30,000 - 32,767
- there are three ports involved when providing this service:
  - the node port, service port, and target port
  - the node port is the port on the host/node
  - the service port is the port on the service object
  - the target port is the port of the pod
- the service listens on the node port and forwards the request to the target port and ip address of the pod
